Atsima

The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Mathematics Alliance (ATSIMA) is an Indigenous-led charity, registered and incorporated in 2015. 

ATSIMA's vision is that ALL ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER STUDENTS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN MATHEMATICS.

To achieve this vision, ATSIMA is creating new ways of teaching and learning mathematics by connecting mathematics to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander histories and cultures. By transforming mathematics education for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander learners, all students benefit.
